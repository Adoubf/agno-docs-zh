## What is phidata?

**Phidata is a toolkit for building AI applications using language models.**

It provides a human-like **Assistant** interface that enables LLMs to achieve tasks using [function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling). Assistants come with built-in **memory**, **knowledge**, **storage** and **tools**, making it possible to build AI applications with ease. You can build:

- **PDF Assistants:** Answer questions using PDFs.
- **Data Assistants:** Analyze data by running SQL queries.
- **Python Assistants:** Perform tasks by running python code.
- **Stock Assistants:** Analyze stocks and research companies.
- **Marketing Assistants:** Provide marketing insights, copywriting and content ideas.
- **Sales Assistants:** Answer customer queries using product descriptions and purchase history.
- **Customer Support Assistants:** Answer customer queries using user manuals.
- **Real Estate Assistants:** Help search property listings using neighborhood information and user preferences.
- **Travel Assistants:** Help plan travel by researching destinations and booking tickets.
- **Meal Prep Assistants:** Help plan meals by researching recipes and adding ingredients to shopping lists.

## Build AI for your product

We've helped many companies build AI features for their products, the general workflow is:

1. Train an assistant with proprietary data to perform tasks specific to your product.
2. Connect to your product to the assistant via an API.
3. Test, Monitor and Improve the AI.

We provide dedicated support and development for AI products. [Book a call](https://cal.com/phidata/intro) to get started.

## Templates

After building an Assistant, we serve it using **Streamlit**, **FastApi** or **Django** to build an AI App. Instead of wiring tools manually, phidata provides **pre-built** templates for AI Apps that you customise and make your own. Here's how they work:

- Create your codebase using a template: `phi ws create`
- Run your app locally: `phi ws up dev:docker`
- Run your app on AWS: `phi ws up prd:aws`

## Get started

1. Read the [basics](/basics) guide to learn the basics.
2. Read the [AI App](/ai-app/run-local) guide to build your own AI App.
3. Checkout the [building blocks](/blocks/overview) for in-depth guides to building AI products.

You can also build your application using one of the following examples
