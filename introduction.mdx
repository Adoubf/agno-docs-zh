## What is phidata?

**Phidata is a toolkit for quickly building AI applications using language models.** It gives you pre-built AI Apps that you can integrate with your product in minutes. Here's how it works:

- Create your codebase using a template: `phi ws create`
- Run your AI App locally: `phi ws up dev:docker`
- Integrate with your product
- Deploy your AI App to AWS: `phi ws up prd:aws`
- Customize, monitor and improve

## Under the hood

Phidata provides a user-friendly **Assistant** interface that enables LLMs to solve tasks by intelligently choosing a course of action using [function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling).

Assistants come with **memory**, **knowledge**, **storage** and **tools** built-in, making it easy to build RAG, Autonomous or Multimodal applications like:

- **Knowledge Assistants:** Answer questions from documents (PDFs, text)
- **Customer Assistants:** Answer customer queries using product descriptions and purchase history.
- **Data Assistants:** Analyze data by running SQL queries.
- **Python Assistants:** Perform tasks by running python code.
- **Stock Assistants:** Analyze stocks and research companies.
- **Marketing Assistants:** Provide marketing insights, copywriting and content ideas.
- **Travel Assistants:** Help plan travel by researching destinations.
- **Meal Prep Assistants:** Help plan meals by researching recipes and adding ingredients to shopping lists.

## Templates

After building an Assistant, we serve it using **Streamlit**, **FastApi** or **Django** to build an AI application. Instead of wiring tools manually, phidata provides **pre-built** templates that you customise and make your own. Here's how they work:

- Create your codebase using a template: `phi ws create`
- Run your app locally: `phi ws up dev:docker`
- Run your app on AWS: `phi ws up prd:aws`

## Get started

1. Read the [basics](/basics) guide to learn the basics.
2. Read the [AI App](/ai-app/run-local) guide to build your own AI App.
3. Checkout the [building blocks](/blocks/overview) for in-depth guides to building AI products.

You can also build your application using one of the following examples

## Building AI for your product

We've helped many companies build AI for their products, the general workflow is:

1. Train an assistant with proprietary data to perform tasks specific to your product.
2. Connect to your product to the assistant via an API.
3. Customize, Monitor and Improve the AI.

We also provide dedicated support and development for AI products. [Book a call](https://cal.com/phidata/intro) to get started.
