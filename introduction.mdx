## What is phidata?

Phidata is an OSS toolkit for building AI products.

It gives you production-ready AI Apps with 1 command.

Its goal is to provide a paved-path for building AI products, for anyone with basic python skills.

## Use it to build

- **AI Apps** (RAG, autonomous or multimodal applications)
- **AI Assistants** (automate data engineering, python or snowflake tasks)
- **Rest Apis** (with FastApi, PostgreSQL)
- **Web Apps** (with Django, PostgreSQL)
- **Data Platforms** (with Airflow, Superset, Jupyter)

## What you get

**Production ready codebases** built with:

- **Building blocks** like conversations, agents, knowledge bases defined as pydantic objects
- **Applications** like FastApi, Streamlit, Django, Postgres defined as pydantic objects
- **Infrastructure** components (docker, AWS) also defined as pydantic objects

Phidata applications run locally using docker and can be deployed to AWS with 1 command.

## How it works

- Create your codebase using a template: `phi ws create`
- Run your app locally: `phi ws up dev:docker`
- Run your app on AWS: `phi ws up prd:aws`

## Advantages

- **Simple:** Application, tools and infrastructure code is written in python
- **Powerful:** Get a production-ready codebase with 1 command
- **Production Ready:** Deploy your application to AWS with 1 command

## Its designed for

- Teams building AI products
- Teams building RestAPI backends
- Teams building Web Apps with Django
- Teams building Data Platforms with Airflow, Superset and Jupyter
