## What is phidata?

Phidata provides the tools to build, ship and monitor AI powered software.

## Use it to build

- **AI Apps** (RAG, autonomous or multimodal applications)
- **AI Assistants** (automate data engineering, python or snowflake tasks)
- **Rest Apis** (with FastApi, PostgreSQL)
- **Web Apps** (with Django, PostgreSQL)
- **Data Platforms** (with Airflow, Superset, Jupyter)

## What you get

**Production ready codebases** for AI Apps, Web Apps and RestAPIs built with:

- A human-like `Conversation` interface to LLMs with built-in knowledge base, storage
- Tools like FastApi, Streamlit, Django, Postgres defined as pydantic classes
- Infrastructure components (docker, AWS) also defined as pydantic classes

Phidata applications run locally using docker and can be deployed to AWS with 1 command.

## How it works

- Create your codebase using a template: `phi ws create`
- Run your app locally: `phi ws up dev:docker`
- Run your app on AWS: `phi ws up prd:aws`

## Its designed for

- Teams building AI products
- Teams building RestAPI backends
- Teams building Web Apps with Django
- Teams building Data Platforms with Airflow, Superset and Jupyter

## Advantages

- **Simple:** Application, tools and infrastructure code is written in python
- **Powerful:** Get a production-ready codebase with 1 command
- **Production Ready:** Deploy your application to AWS with 1 command

## Get started
