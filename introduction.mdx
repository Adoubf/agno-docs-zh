## What is phidata?

**Phidata is a toolkit for building intelligent AI applications.**

<p className="hidden">

Phidata provides pre-built templates for building intelligent AI applications. AI Engineers can build their own AI App using these templates in 3 steps:

- Create your codebase using: `phi ws create`
- Run your AI app locally: `phi ws up`
- Deploy your AI app to AWS: `phi ws up prd:aws`

</p>

It provides a framework for building AI Assistants using function calling - a powerful paradigm that gives LLMs the ability to take actions and dynamically choose their path based on the response,
just like how humans solve problems. Assistants come with memory, knowledge, storage and tools, making it easy to build intelligent AI applications.

<p className="hidden">"LLM = Large Language Model"</p>

## Use phidata to build

- **Knowledge Assistants:** Answer questions from documents (PDFs, text)
- **Data Assistants:** Analyze data by running SQL queries.
- **Python Assistants:** Perform tasks by running python code.
- **Customer Assistants:** Answer customer queries using product descriptions and purchase history.
- **Research Assistants:** Perform research and summarize findings.
- **Marketing Assistants:** Provide marketing insights, copywriting and content ideas.
- **Travel Assistants:** Help plan travel by researching destinations, flight and hotel prices.
- **Meal Prep Assistants:** Help plan meals by researching recipes and adding ingredients to shopping lists.

## Templates

After building an Assistant, we serve it using **Streamlit**, **FastApi** or **Django** to build an AI application. Instead of wiring these tools manually, phidata provides **pre-built** templates for AI Apps that you can run locally or deploy to AWS with 1 command. Here's how they work:

- Create your AI App using a template: `phi ws create`
- Run your app locally: `phi ws up`
- Run your app on AWS: `phi ws up prd:aws`

## Demos

- [Streamlit App](https://demo.aidev.run/) serving a PDF, Image and Website Assistant (password: **admin**)
- [FastApi App](https://api.aidev.run/docs) serving a PDF Assistant.

## Getting started

1. Read the [basics](/basics) guide to learn the basics.
2. Read the [AI App](/ai-app/run-local) guide to build your own AI App.
3. Checkout the [building blocks](/blocks/overview) for in-depth guides to building AI products.

You can also build your application using one of the following examples

## Building AI for your product?

We've helped many companies build AI for their products, the general workflow is:

1. **Train an assistant** with proprietary data to perform tasks specific to your product.
2. **Connect your product** to your assistant via a RestAPI.
3. **Customize, Monitor and Improve** the AI.

We provide dedicated support and development for AI products. [Book a call](https://cal.com/phidata/intro) to get started.
