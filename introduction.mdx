**Agno is a lightweight framework for building Agents with memory, knowledge, tools and reasoning.**

Use Agno to build Reasoning Agents, Multimodal Agents, Teams of Agents and Agentic Workflows. Here's an Agent that writes a financial report by reasoning through each step:

```python reasoning_finance_agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.tools.reasoning import ReasoningTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id="claude-3-7-sonnet-latest"),
    tools=[
        ReasoningTools(add_instructions=True),
        YFinanceTools(stock_price=True, analyst_recommendations=True, company_info=True, company_news=True),
    ],
    instructions=[
        "Use tables to display data",
        "Only output the report, no other text",
    ],
    markdown=True,
)
agent.print_response("Write a report on NVDA", stream=True, show_full_reasoning=True, stream_intermediate_steps=True)
```

# Key features

Agno is simple, fast and model agnostic. Here are some key features:

- **Model Agnostic**: Agno provides a unified interface for 23+ model providers, no lock-in.
- **Lightning Fast**: Agents instantiate 10,000x faster than LangGraph and use 50x less memory (see [benchmarks](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno#performance)).
- **First class support for Reasoning**: Build Agents that can "think" and "analyze" using Reasoning Models, Reasoning Tools or our custom `CoT+Tool-use` approach.
- **Natively Multi Modal**: Agents can take in text, image, audio and video and generate text, image, audio and video as output.
- **Advanced Multi Agent Architecture**: Industry leading multi-agent architecture with 3 different modes: `route`, `collaborate` and `coordinate`.
- **Long-term Memory**: Built in support for long-term memory with our `Storage` and `Memory` classes.
- **20+ Vector Databases for Knowledge**: Add domain knowledge to your Agents by integrating with 20+ vector databases. Fully async and highly performant.
- **Structured Outputs**: First class support for structured outputs using native structured outputs or `json_mode`.
- **Monitoring**: Track agent sessions and performance in real-time on [agno.com](https://app.agno.com).
