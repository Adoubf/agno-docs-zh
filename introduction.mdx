## What is phidata?

Phidata is an [OSS](https://github.com/phidatahq/phidata) toolkit for building AI powered software.

## Use it to build

- **AI Apps** (RAG, autonomous or multimodal applications)
- **AI Agents** (automate tasks using AI)
- **Rest Apis** (with FastApi, PostgreSQL)
- **Web Apps** (with Django, PostgreSQL)
- **Data Platforms** (with Airflow, Superset, Jupyter)

For example:

- **PDF Assistants:** Answer questions using PDFs.
- **Python Engineers:** Perform tasks by writing and running python scripts.
- **Data Analysts:** Analyze data by writing and running SQL queries.
- **Stock Analysts:** Analyze stocks and research companies.
- **Marketing Analysts:** Provide marketing insights, copywriting and content ideas.

## How it works

Phidata gives you **pre-built templates** that you can run within minutes

- Create your codebase using a template: `phi ws create`
- Run your app locally: `phi ws up dev:docker`
- Run your app on AWS: `phi ws up prd:aws`

## Advantages

- **Simple:** Application, tools and infrastructure code is written in python
- **Powerful:** Get a production-ready codebase with 1 command
- **Production Ready:** Deploy your application to AWS with 1 command

## Get started

1. Follow the [basics](/basics) guide to learn the basics.
2. Follow the [AI App](/ai-app/run-local) guide to build your own AI App.
