## What is phidata?

**Phidata is an [open source](https://github.com/phidatahq/phidata) toolkit for building AI Apps.** It provides pre-built templates you can use to build your AI product. Here's how it works:

- Create your AI App using a template: `phi ws create`
- Run your AI App locally: `phi ws up`
- Integrate with your product.
- Deploy your AI App to AWS: `phi ws up prd:aws`
- Monitor and improve.

## Under the hood

Phidata provides **Assistants** that use LLMs to solve problems by calling functions. This is a powerful paradigm that allows LLMs to solve complex problems by intelligently choosing a course of action -- similar to how a human would solve a problem.

For example, to answer questions from a database, an Assistant will first call a function to show tables, then describe those tables and finally, run a query to get the answer.

Assistants come with their own memory, knowledge base and storage, making it easy to build **RAG**, **Autonomous** or **Multimodal** applications like:

- **Knowledge Assistants:** Answer questions from documents (PDFs, text)
- **Data Assistants:** Analyze data by running SQL queries.
- **Python Assistants:** Perform tasks by running python code.
- **Customer Assistants:** Answer customer queries using product descriptions and purchase history.
- **Research Assistants:** Perform research and summarize findings.
- **Marketing Assistants:** Provide marketing insights, copywriting and content ideas.
- **Travel Assistants:** Help plan travel by researching destinations, flight and hotel prices.
- **Meal Prep Assistants:** Help plan meals by researching recipes and adding ingredients to shopping lists.

## Templates

After building an Assistant, we serve it using **Streamlit**, **FastApi** or **Django** to build an AI application. Instead of wiring tools manually, phidata provides **pre-built** templates that you customise and make your own. Here's how they work:

- Create your codebase using a template: `phi ws create`
- Run your app locally: `phi ws up`
- Run your app on AWS: `phi ws up prd:aws`

## Get started

1. Read the [basics](/basics) guide to learn the basics.
2. Read the [AI App](/ai-app/run-local) guide to build your own AI App.
3. Checkout the [building blocks](/blocks/overview) for in-depth guides to building AI products.

You can also build your application using one of the following examples

## Building AI for your product?

We've helped many companies build AI for their products, the general workflow is:

1. **Train an Assistant** with proprietary data to perform tasks specific to your product.
2. **Connect to your product** to the assistant via a RestAPI.
3. **Customize, Monitor and Improve** the AI.

We provide dedicated support and development for AI products. [Book a call](https://cal.com/phidata/intro) to get started.
