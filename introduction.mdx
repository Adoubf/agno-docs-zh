## What is phidata?

**Phidata is a toolkit for building AI Assistants using function calling.**

Function calling enables LLMs to achieve tasks by calling functions and intelligently choosing their next step based on the response, just like how humans solve problems.

## How it works

- **Step 1:** Create an `Assistant`
- **Step 2:** Add Tools (functions), Knowledge (vectordb) and Storage (database)
- **Step 3:** Serve using Streamlit, FastApi or Django to build your AI application

To make the process simpler, phidata also provides pre-built templates for building AI applications. You can build an AI App using a pre-built template in 3 steps:

- Create your codebase using: `phi ws create`
- Run your AI app locally: `phi ws up`
- Deploy your AI app to AWS: `phi ws up prd:aws`

## Quickstart

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install phidata">

    ```bash
    pip install -U phidata
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an Assistant">

    Create a file `assistant.py` and install openai using `pip install openai`

    ```python assistant.py
    from phi.assistant import Assistant

    assistant = Assistant(description="You help people with their health and fitness goals.")
    assistant.print_response("Share a quick healthy breakfast recipe.")
    ```

    Set your `OPENAI_API_KEY`

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash Mac
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-***
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    setx OPENAI_API_KEY sk-***
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    Run the `Assistant`

    ```shell
    python assistant.py
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a tool">

    Add the DuckDuckGo tool to let the assistant search the web

    ```python assistant.py
    from phi.assistant import Assistant
    from phi.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGo

    assistant = Assistant(tools=[DuckDuckGo()], show_tool_calls=True)
    assistant.print_response("Whats happening in France?")
    ```

    Install duckduckgo search

    ```shell
    pip install duckduckgo-search
    ```

    Run the `Assistant`

    ```shell
    python assistant.py
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Demos

Checkout some of these applications showcasing the advantage of function calling:

- [PDF AI](https://pdf.aidev.run/) that summarizes and answers questions from PDFs.
- [ArXiv AI](https://arxiv.aidev.run/) that answers questions about ArXiv papers using the ArXiv API.
- [HackerNews AI](https://hn.aidev.run/) that interacts with the HN API to summarize stories, users, find out what's trending, summarize topics.
- [Streamlit App](https://demo.aidev.run/) serving a PDF, Image and Website Assistant (password: **admin**)
- [FastApi App](https://api.aidev.run/docs) serving a PDF Assistant.

## Templates

After building an Assistant, serve it using **Streamlit**, **FastApi** or **Django** to build an AI application. Instead of wiring these tools manually, phidata provides **pre-built** templates for AI Apps that you can run locally or deploy to AWS with 1 command. Here's how they work:

- Create your AI App using a template: `phi ws create`
- Run your app locally: `phi ws up`
- Run your app on AWS: `phi ws up prd:aws`

## Get started

1. Read the [basics](/basics) guide to learn the basics.
2. Follow the [AI App](/ai-app/run-local) guide to build your own AI App.
3. Checkout the [building blocks](/blocks/overview) for in-depth guides to building AI products.

## Examples

You can also build your application using one of the following examples

## Building AI for your product?

We've helped many companies build AI for their products, the general workflow is:

1. **Train an assistant** with proprietary data to perform tasks specific to your product.
2. **Connect your product** to the assistant via an API.
3. **Customize, Monitor and Improve** the AI.

We provide dedicated support and development for AI products. [Book a call](https://cal.com/phidata/intro) to get started.
