## What is phidata?

**Phidata is a toolkit for building AI Assistants using language models.**

Assistants achieve tasks by intelligently choosing their course of action by [function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling).

They come with built-in **memory**, **knowledge**, **storage** and **tools**, making it easy to build any kind of RAG, Autonomous or Multimodal application. For example:

- **PDF Assistants:** Answer questions using PDFs.
- **Data Assistants:** Analyze data by running SQL queries.
- **Python Assistants:** Perform tasks by running python code.
- **Stock Assistants:** Analyze stocks and research companies.
- **Marketing Assistants:** Provide marketing insights, copywriting and content ideas.
- **Sales Assistants:** Answer customer queries using product descriptions and purchase history.
- **Customer Support Assistants:** Answer customer queries using user manuals.
- **Real Estate Assistants:** Help search property listings using neighborhood information and user preferences.
- **Travel Assistants:** Help plan travel by researching destinations and booking tickets.
- **Cooking Assistants:** Help plan meals by researching recipes and adding ingredients to shopping lists.

<Tip>

The future of productivity includes multiple AI Assistants, build yours today.

## Templates

After building an Assistant, we serve it using **Streamlit**, **FastApi** or **Django** to build an AI App. Instead of wiring tools manually, phidata provides **pre-built** templates for AI Apps that you can run in minutes. Here's how they work:

- Create your codebase using a template: `phi ws create`
- Run your app locally: `phi ws up dev:docker`
- Run your app on AWS: `phi ws up prd:aws`

## Get started

1. Read the [basics](/basics) guide to learn the basics.
2. Read the [AI App](/ai-app/run-local) guide to build your own AI App.
3. Checkout the [building blocks](/blocks/overview) for in-depth guides to building AI products.

You can also build your application using one of the following examples
