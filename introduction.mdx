## What is phidata?

Phidata is a toolkit for building human-like AI products using language models.

Like we have conversations with human specialists, phidata provides a `Conversation` interface to AI specialists. Conversations come with built-in memory, knowledge, storage, tools and can be used to build pretty much any kind of AI application. For example:

- **PDF Assistants:** Answer questions using PDFs.
- **Python Engineers:** Perform tasks by writing and running python scripts.
- **Data Analysts:** Analyze data by writing and running SQL queries.
- **Stock Analysts:** Analyze stocks and research companies.
- **Marketing Analysts:** Provide marketing insights, copywriting and content ideas.
