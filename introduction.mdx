**Agno is a lightweight library for building Reasoning Agents that have long-term memory, domain-specific knowledge, and can use tools to interact with the real world.**

Developers use Agno to build Reasoning Agents, Multimodal Agents, Teams of Agents and Agentic Workflows. Agno also provides a beautiful UI to chat with Agents and tools to monitor and evaluate Agents.

Here's an Agent that researches and writes a report on a stock, reasoning through each step:

```python reasoning_finance_agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.tools.reasoning import ReasoningTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id="claude-3-7-sonnet-latest"),
    tools=[
        ReasoningTools(add_instructions=True),
        YFinanceTools(stock_price=True, analyst_recommendations=True, company_info=True, company_news=True),
    ],
    instructions=[
        "Use tables to display data",
        "Only output the report, no other text",
    ],
    markdown=True,
)
agent.print_response("Write a report on NVDA", stream=True, show_full_reasoning=True, stream_intermediate_steps=True)
```

# Key features

Agno is simple, fast and model-agnostic. Here are some key features:

- **Model Agnostic**: Agno provides a unified interface to 23+ model providers, no lock-in.
- **Lightning Fast**: Agents instantiate in **~2Î¼s** on average (10,000x faster than LangGraph) and use **~3.75Kib** memory on average (50x less than LangGraph) (see [benchmarks](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno#performance)).
- **Reasoning is a first class citizen**: Build Agents that can "think" and "analyze" using Reasoning Models, `ReasoningTools` or our custom `CoT+Tool-use` approach.
- **Natively Multi Modal**: Agno Agents are natively multi modal, they can take in text, image, audio and video and generate text, image, audio and video as output.
- **Advanced Multi Agent Architecture**: Agno provides an industry leading multi-agent architecture with 3 different modes: `route`, `collaborate` and `coordinate`.
- **Long-term Memory & Session Storage**: Agno provides `Storage` & `Memory` classes to provide your Agents with long-term memory and session storage.
- **20+ Vector Databases for Knowledge**: Add domain knowledge to your Agents by integrating with 20+ vector databases. **Fully async and highly performant.**
- **Structured Outputs**: Agno Agents have first class support for structured outputs using native structured outputs or `json_mode`.
- **Monitoring**: Monitor agent sessions and performance in real-time on [agno.com](https://app.agno.com).

# Getting Started

If you're new to Agno, start by building your [first Agent](/introduction/agents), then chat with it on the [Agent playground](/introduction/playground) and finally monitor it on [agno.com](/introduction/monitoring).
