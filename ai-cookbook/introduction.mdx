The [AI Cookbook](https://github.com/phidatahq/ai-cookbook) contains a bunch of recipes for building different types of AI products. From simple conversations to advanced fine-tuning and evaluations.

You can run each recipe individually or clone the [AI Cookbook](https://github.com/phidatahq/ai-cookbook) repo and run it from there.

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a virtual environment">
    Open the `Terminal` and create an `ai` directory with a python virtual environment.

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash Mac
    mkdir ai && cd ai

    python3 -m venv aienv
    source aienv/bin/activate
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    mkdir ai; cd ai

    python3 -m venv aienv
    aienv/scripts/activate
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Install phidata">
    Install `phidata` pip

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash Mac
    pip install -U phidata
    ```

  <Step title="Set your OpenAI key">

    Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to your OpenAI Key. You can get one [from OpenAI here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys). Otherwise `phi` provides ready to use access to OpenAI models.
