title: Teams

We can combine multiple Agents to form a team and tackle tasks as a cohesive unit.

Here's an example:

```python hn_team.py
from phi.agent import Agent
from phi.tools.hackernews import HackerNews


story_researcher = Agent(
    name="HackerNews Story Researcher",
    role="Researches hackernews stories and users.",
    tools=[HackerNews()],
)
user_researcher = Agent(
    name="HackerNews User Researcher",
    role="Reads articles from URLs.",
    tools=[HackerNews()],
)

hn_leader = Agent(
    name="Hackernews Team",
    team=[story_researcher, user_researcher],
    markdown=True,
)
hn_leader.print_response("Write a report about the users with the top 2 stories on hackernews", stream=True)
```

## How to build Agent Teams

1. Add a `name` and `role` parameter to the member Agents.
2. Create a Team Leader that can delegate tasks to team-members.
3. Use your Agent team just like you would use a regular Agent.

<Warning>
Open-ended Agentic teams are great to play with, but are not reliable for real-world problems that require high reliability.

They need constant oversight and can run in loops if not monitored. This drawback should improve as models get better (eagerly waiting for GPT5).
</Warning>
