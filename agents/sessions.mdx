Agents are able to maintain a conversation with one or more users. Before we dive in, let's understand the terminology:

- **Session:** Each conversation with an Agent is called a **session**. Sessions are identified by a `session_id` and should be unique for each user.
- **Run:** Every interaction (i.e. chat) within a session is called a **run**. Runs are identified by a `run_id`.
- **Messages:** are the individual messages sent to and received from the model. They have a `role` (`system`, `user` or `assistant`) and `content`.

<Tip>
**Sessions** are equivalent to **threads** in the OpenAI Assistant API.

Below is an example where a single run is created with an Agent. A `session_id` is automatically generated and added to the run. This won't be associated with any specific user.

```python
from typing import Iterator
from agno.agent import Agent, RunResponse
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.utils.pprint import pprint_run_response

agent = Agent(model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"))

# Run agent and return the response as a variable
agent.print_response("Tell me a 5 second short story about a robot")
```

## Multiple Users with Sessions

Sessions are unique for each user. If you want to maintain a conversation with multiple users, you can use the `user_id` and `session_id` to identify the session.

This requires storage of sessions. See [storage](/agents/storage) for more information.

```python
from typing import Iterator
from agno.agent import Agent, RunResponse
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.utils.pprint import pprint_run_response
from agno.storage.postgres import PostgresStorage

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"), 
    storage=PostgresStorage(table_name="agent_sessions", db_url="postgresql+psycopg://ai:ai@localhost:5532/ai"),
)

user_1_id = "user_101"
user_2_id = "user_102"

user_1_session_id = "session_101"
user_2_session_id = "session_102"

# Start the session with user 1
agent.print_response("Tell me a 5 second short story about a robot.", user_id=user_1_id, session_id=user_1_session_id)
# Continue the session with user 1
agent.print_response("Now tell me a joke.", user_id=user_1_id, session_id=user_1_session_id)

# Start the session with user 2
agent.print_response("Tell me about quantum physics.", user_id=user_2_id, session_id=user_2_session_id)
# Continue the session with user 2
agent.print_response("What is the speed of light?", user_id=user_2_id, session_id=user_2_session_id)

# Continue the session with user 1
agent.print_response("What can you tell me about what AIs are capable of?", user_id=user_1_id, session_id=user_1_session_id)
```
