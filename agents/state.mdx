title: Agent State
---

A common use case for Agents is to maintain state across multiple runs and Agno's powerful state management system offers an elegant way to handle this. Here's how:

1. Add a `session_state` dictionary to your Agent and it will be persisted across the entire session. This `session_state` is available to all tools, and the "keys" (i.e. the variable names) are available to use in instructions, descriptions, and more.
2. If you add storage to your Agent, the `session_state` dictionary is persisted in the database so will be available across execution cycles as well.

<Tip>
This is as good and elegant as state management gets.

Here's an example of an Agent that maintains a shopping list:

```python session_state.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

# Define a tool that increments our counter and returns the new value
def add_item(agent: Agent, item: str) -> str:
    """Add an item to the shopping list."""
    agent.session_state["shopping_list"].append(item)
    return f"The shopping list is now {agent.session_state['shopping_list']}"


# Create an Agent that maintains state
agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
    # Initialize the session state with a counter starting at 0
    session_state={"shopping_list": []},
    tools=[add_item],
    # You can use variables from the session state in the instructions
    instructions="Current state (shopping list) is: {shopping_list}",
    # Important: Add the state to the messages
    add_state_in_messages=True,
    markdown=True,
)

# Example usage
agent.print_response("Add milk, eggs, and bread to the shopping list", stream=True)
print(f"Final session state: {agent.session_state}")
```

## What is State?

**State** is any kind of data the Agent needs access to and manage throughout runs.

<Check>
A simple, yet common use case for Agents is to manage lists, items and other "information" for a user. For example, a shopping list, a todo list, a wishlist, etc.

This can be easily managed using the `session_state`. The Agent updates the `session_state` dictionary in tool calls and exposes them to the Model in the `description` and `instructions`.
</Check>

Here's how Agno's state management works:
- The `Agent` object has a `session_state` parameter.
- We add our state variables to this `session_state` dictionary.
- We update the `session_state` dictionary in tool calls or other functions.
- We expose the current `session_state` to the Model in the `description`, `instructions` and `user_messages`.
- The `session_state` is also stored with Agent sessions, so is persisted in a database. Meaning, it is available across multiple runs.

<Note>
Make sure to only add `serializable` objects to `session_state` **if you're using storage**. The `session_state` is stored in a database and needs to be serializable.
</Note>

## Maintaining state across multiple runs

A big advantage of **sessions** is the ability to maintain state across multiple runs. For example, let's say the agent is helping a user keep track of their shopping list.

<Note>
By setting `add_state_in_messages=True`, the keys of the `session_state` dictionary are available in the `description` and `instructions` as variables.

Use this pattern to add the shopping_list to the instructions directly.
</Note>

```python shopping_list.py
from textwrap import dedent

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat


# Define tools to manage our shopping list
def add_item(agent: Agent, item: str) -> str:
    """Add an item to the shopping list and return confirmation."""
    # Add the item if it's not already in the list
    if item.lower() not in [i.lower() for i in agent.session_state["shopping_list"]]:
        agent.session_state["shopping_list"].append(item)
        return f"Added '{item}' to the shopping list"
    else:
        return f"'{item}' is already in the shopping list"


def remove_item(agent: Agent, item: str) -> str:
    """Remove an item from the shopping list by name."""
    # Case-insensitive search
    for i, list_item in enumerate(agent.session_state["shopping_list"]):
        if list_item.lower() == item.lower():
            agent.session_state["shopping_list"].pop(i)
            return f"Removed '{list_item}' from the shopping list"

    return f"'{item}' was not found in the shopping list"


def list_items(agent: Agent) -> str:
    """List all items in the shopping list."""
    shopping_list = agent.session_state["shopping_list"]

    if not shopping_list:
        return "The shopping list is empty."

    items_text = "\n".join([f"- {item}" for item in shopping_list])
    return f"Current shopping list:\n{items_text}"


# Create a Shopping List Manager Agent that maintains state
agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
    # Initialize the session state with an empty shopping list
    session_state={"shopping_list": []},
    tools=[add_item, remove_item, list_items],
    # You can use variables from the session state in the instructions
    instructions=dedent("""\
        Your job is to manage a shopping list.

        The shopping list starts empty. You can add items, remove items by name, and list all items.

        Current shopping list: {shopping_list}
    """),
    show_tool_calls=True,
    add_state_in_messages=True,
    markdown=True,
)

# Example usage
agent.print_response("Add milk, eggs, and bread to the shopping list", stream=True)
print(f"Session state: {agent.session_state}")

agent.print_response("I got bread", stream=True)
print(f"Session state: {agent.session_state}")

agent.print_response("I need apples and oranges", stream=True)
print(f"Session state: {agent.session_state}")

agent.print_response("whats on my list?", stream=True)
print(f"Session state: {agent.session_state}")

agent.print_response("Clear everything from my list and start over with just bananas and yogurt", stream=True)
print(f"Session state: {agent.session_state}")
```

<Tip>
We love how elegantly we can maintain and pass on state across multiple runs.
</Tip>

## Using state in Instructions

You can use variables from the session state in the instructions.

<Tip>
Don't use the f-string syntax in the instructions. Directly use the `{key}` syntax, Agno substitutes the values for you.
</Tip>

```python state_in_instructions.py
from textwrap import dedent

from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat


agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o-mini"),
    # Initialize the session state with a variable
    session_state={"user_name": "John"},
    # You can use variables from the session state in the instructions
    instructions="Users name is {user_name}",
    show_tool_calls=True,
    add_state_in_messages=True,
    markdown=True,
)

agent.print_response("What is my name?", stream=True)
```
