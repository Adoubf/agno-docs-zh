## Phidata Agents

- Use language models for reasoning and planning.
- Use tools to take actions and interact with external systems.
- Store memory and state in a database, remembering chat history, user preferences and conversation summaries.
- Store knowledge in vector databases to supplement their training data with domain expertise.

## Example: Research Agent

Let's create a research agent that can search the web, read the top links and write a report for us. We **"prompt"** the agent using `description` and `instructions`.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Research Agent">
    Create a file `research_agent.py`

    ```python research_agent.py
    from phi.agent import Agent
    from phi.model.openai import OpenAIChat
    from phi.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGo
    from phi.tools.newspaper4k import Newspaper4k

    agent = Agent(
        model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
        tools=[DuckDuckGo(), Newspaper4k()],
        description="You are a senior NYT researcher writing an article on a topic.",
        instructions=[
            "For a given topic, search for the top 5 links.",
            "Then read each URL and extract the article text, if a URL isn't available, ignore it.",
            "Analyse and prepare an NYT worthy article based on the information.",
        ],
        markdown=True,
        show_tool_calls=True,
        add_datetime_to_instructions=True,
        # debug_mode=True,
    )
    agent.print_response("Simulation theory", stream=True)
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the agent">
    Install libraries

    ```shell
    pip install phidata openai duckduckgo-search newspaper4k lxml_html_clean
    ```

    Run the agent

    ```shell
    python research_agent.py
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Under the hood, the description and instructions are converted to the system prompt and the input (e.g. `Simulation theory`) is passed as the user prompt.

Use `debug_mode=True` to view the raw logs behind the scenes.
</Note>

## Capturing the Agent's response in a variable

While `Agent.print_response()` is useful for quick experiments, you will typically want to capture the agent's response in a variable to either pass to your frontend, another agent or use in your application.

The `Agent.run()` function returns the response as a `RunResponse` object.

```python
from phi.agent import Agent, RunResponse
from phi.utils.pprint import pprint_run_response

agent = Agent(...)

# Run agent and return the response as a variable
response: RunResponse = agent.run("Simulation theory")
# Print the response in markdown format
pprint_run_response(response, markdown=True)
```

By default `stream=False`, set `stream=True` to return a stream of `RunResponse` objects.

```python
from typing import Iterator

# Run agent and return the response as a stream
response_stream: Iterator[RunResponse] = agent.run("Simulation theory", stream=True)
# Print the response stream in markdown format
pprint_run_response(response_stream, markdown=True, show_time=True)
```

## RunResponse

The `Agent.run()` function returns a `RunResponse` object or an `Iterator[RunResponse]` if `stream=True`.

### RunResponse Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `content` | `Any` | `None` | Content of the response. |
| `content_type` | `str` | `"str"` | Specifies the data type of the content. |
| `context` | `List[MessageContext]` | `None` | The context added to the response for RAG. |
| `event` | `str` | `RunEvent.run_response.value` | Event type of the response. |
| `event_data` | `Dict[str, Any]` | `None` | Data associated with the event. |
| `messages` | `List[Message]` | `None` | A list of messages included in the response. |
| `metrics` | `Dict[str, Any]` | `None` | Usage metrics of the run. |
| `model` | `str` | `None` | The model used in the run. |
| `run_id` | `str` | `None` | Run Id. |
| `agent_id` | `str` | `None` | Agent Id for the run. |
| `session_id` | `str` | `None` | Session Id for the run. |
| `tools` | `List[Dict[str, Any]]` | `None` | List of tools provided to the model. |
| `created_at` | `int` | - | Unix timestamp of the response creation. |
