Let's build a Multimodal LLM App powered by GPT-4V. We'll use PgVector for knowledge and storage and serve the app using Streamlit.

## What is Multimodal?

Multimodal means the LLM can work with images along with text. Historically, language model systems have been limited to text but **GPT-4V** can also understand images (and with some workarounds - videos too). This unlocks a powerful set of new use-cases for LLMs.

**By the end of this guide have your own Multimodal LLM App.**

### Chat with Images

- Open [localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) to view streamlit apps that you can customize and make your own.
- Click on **Chat with Images** in the sidebar
- Enter a username.
- Upload an image and ask questions
- Click on `Generate Caption`, `Describe Image`, `Identify Brands`, `Identify Items` for examples.

## How this App works

This streamlit app is defined in the `app/pages/2_Chat_with_Images.py` file and the `Conversation` powering these apps are defined in the `llm/conversations/vision.py` file.

Checkout the `llm/conversations/vision.py` file for more information.

## Serve your App using FastApi

<Note>

We are working on a set of common endpoints for the Multimodal LLM App.
