Let's build a RAG AI App powered by GPT-4. We'll use PgVector for knowledge and storage and serve the app using Streamlit and FastApi.

## What is RAG?

Retrieval Augmented Generation means providing the LLM with additional information along with the question to improve its responses. Here's how it works:

- Without RAG, a user asks the LLM a question and the LLM responds with information from its training data.
- With RAG, a user asks the LLM a question and we "stuff the prompt" with relevant information from a knowledge base. The LLM then responds in a context-aware manner.
- Using RAG is like taking an open-book test.

**By the end of this guide have your own RAG AI App.**
