Junior DE is an LLM App for data analysts, engineers and scientists to offload the daily, mundane data tasks. It can:

- Write python scripts for processing data, creating charts
- Analyze CSV, Parquet or JSON data using DuckDb.
- Write complex queries including joins and filtering.
- Run data transformations and export the results.
- Explain analysis step-by-step.

The best part is that it inspects, validates and runs the code like a regular engineer. It also plays well with long-term, multi-turn conversations. Follow along to run your own Junior DE:

**By the end of this guide have your own Junior DE**

## Create your codebase

Create your codebase using the `junior-de` template pre-configured with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and [PgVector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector).

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
phi ws create -t junior-de -n junior-de
```

```bash Windows
phi ws create -t junior-de -n junior-de
```

</CodeGroup>

This will create a folder `junior-de` with the following structure:

```bash
junior-de                     # root directory for your Junior DE
├── app                     # directory for Streamlit apps
├── duckgpt                 # directory for the DuckDb data engineer
├── pygpt                   # directory for the Python data engineer
├── notebooks               # directory for Jupyter notebooks
├── data                    # directory for local data files
├── Dockerfile              # Dockerfile for the application
├── pyproject.toml          # python project definition
├── requirements.txt        # python dependencies managed by pyproject.toml
├── scripts                 # directory for helper scripts
├── utils                   # directory for utilities
└── workspace               # phidata workspace directory
    ├── dev_resources.py    # dev resources running locally
    ├── prd_resources.py    # production resources running on AWS
    ├── jupyter             # jupyter notebook resources
    ├── secrets             # directory for storing secrets
    └── settings.py         # phidata workspace settings
```

## Run Junior DE locally

Start your Junior DE using:

<CodeGroup>

```bash terminal
phi ws up
```

```bash shorthand
phi ws up dev:docker
```

</CodeGroup>

**Press Enter** to confirm and give a few minutes for the image to download (only the first time). Verify container status and view logs on the docker dashboard.

## PyGPT: Automate Data Analysis using Python

- Open [localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501) to access your Junior DE.
- Your first Junior DE is **PyGPT**, it can write python scripts for processing data, create charts and more. Click on **PyGPT** and enter a username.
- Ask "Show me revenue per year"
- Each script that PyGPT created is saved to the `pygpt/op` folder.
- See your Junior DE work through the problem.

## Add your data

The data used by `PyGPT` is defined in the `pygpt/csv_files.py` file.

- Add `csv` files to the `data/` folder and then to the `csv_files` list.
- The more information we can provide about the file, the better the results.

## How PyGPT works

The `Conversation` powering `PyGPT` is defined in the `llm/conversations/pygpt.py` file. You can customize the prompts and adapt the Junior DE to your workflow.

```python llm/conversations/pygpt.py
...
    return Conversation(
        ...
        agents=[python_agent],;
        system_prompt=f"""\
        You are a Data Engineering assistant designed to perform tasks using Python.
        ...
    )
...
```

The `PythonAgent()` defined in the `llm/agents/python_agent.py` file provides the `Tools` used by GPT-4.

## DuckGPT: Automate Data Analysis using DuckDb

- Your second Junior DE is **DuckGPT** that can write and run SQL queries using DuckDb.
- Click on **DuckGPT Local** and enter a username.
- Ask "Show me revenue over time"
- See your Junior DE work through the problem.
- Ask "Save it" to save the query to the `/duckgpt/op` folder.

![Junior DE: DuckGPT Local](/images/duckdb_de_local.jpeg)

## Add your data

The data used by local `DuckGPT` is defined in the `duckgpt/local_tables.py` file.

- Add `csv` files to the `data/` folder and then to the `local_tables` list.
- These tables are created using a `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE '{name}' AS SELECT * FROM '{path}';` command so can accept any file type supported by DuckDb.
- You can also define custom data loading operations in the `load_local_tables()` function and click on the **Load All Tables** button to load the DuckDb database manually.

## How DuckGPT works

The `Conversation` powering `DuckGPT` is defined in the `llm/conversations/duckgpt_local.py` file. You can customize the prompts and adapt the Junior DE to your workflow.

```python llm/conversations/duckgpt_local.py
...
    return Conversation(
        ...
        agents=[duckdb_local_agent],;
        system_prompt=f"""\
        You are a Data Engineering assistant designed to answer questions using DuckDb.
        ...
    )
...
```

The `DuckDbAgent()` defined in the `llm/agents/duckdb_agent.py` file provides the `Tools` used by GPT-4.

## DuckGPT on S3 data

- Click on **DuckGPT S3** and enter a username.
- Ask "Which actor has the highest average movie rating? ignore those with under 25 moviees and total 1000000 votes."
- See your Junior DE work through a complex problem.

<Note>

The first query takes a few minutes as a lot of data from s3 is loaded into memory. You can pre-load data using the `Load All Tables` button or use your own (smaller) datasets.

</Note>

![Junior DE: DuckGPT S3](/images/junior-de-duckgpt-s3.png)

## Add S3 data

The tables used by S3 `DuckGPT` are defined in the `duckgpt/s3_tables.py` file.

- Add your S3 `tables` and the `relationships` between them. These aren't necessary but help improve the responses of the LLM.
- These tables are created using a `CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE '{name}' AS SELECT * FROM '{path}';` command so can accept any file type supported by DuckDb.
- You can also define custom data loading operations in the `load_s3_tables()` function and click on the **Load All Tables** button to load the DuckDb database manually.

## Optional: Run Jupyterlab

A jupyter notebook is a must have for AI development and your `junior-de` comes with a notebook pre-installed with the required dependencies. To start your notebook:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Jupyter">
    Update the `workspace/settings.py` file and set `dev_jupyter_enabled=True`

    ```python workspace/settings.py
    ...
    ws_settings = WorkspaceSettings(
        ...
        # Uncomment the following line
        dev_jupyter_enabled=True,
    ...
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Start Jupyter">

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash terminal
    phi ws up --group jupyter
    ```

    ```bash shorthand
    phi ws up dev:docker:jupyter
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    **Press Enter** to confirm and give a few minutes for the image to download (only the first time). Verify container status and view logs on the docker dashboard.

  </Step>
  <Step title="View JupyterLab UI">
    - Open [localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888) to view the Jupyterlab UI. Password: **admin**
    - Open `notebooks/local_duckgpt` to run DuckGPT on local data.
