## Serve your App using FastApi

Streamlit is great for building micro front-ends but any production application will be built using a front-end framework like [next.js](https://nextjs.org) backed by a RestApi built using [FastApi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

Your AI App comes ready-to-use with FastApi endpoints, start the `api` group using:

<CodeGroup>

```bash terminal
phi ws up --group api
```

```bash shorthand
phi ws up dev:docker:api
```

</CodeGroup>
