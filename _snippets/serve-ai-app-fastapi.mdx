## Serve your App using FastApi

Streamlit is great for building micro front-ends but any production application will be built using a front-end framework like [next.js](https://nextjs.org) backed by a RestApi built using [FastApi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

Your AI App comes ready-to-use with FastApi endpoints.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable FastApi">
    Update the `workspace/settings.py` file and set `dev_api_enabled=True`

    ```python workspace/settings.py
    ...
    ws_settings = WorkspaceSettings(
        ...
        # Uncomment the following line
        dev_api_enabled=True,
    ...
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Start FastApi">
