## Optional: Build your AI Product

The `api-app` provides sample endpoints for building your own AI product. These routes are developed in collaboration with real AI Apps and are a great starting point to build upon.

For example:

- Call the `/conversation/create` endpoint to create a new conversation for a user.

```json
{
  "user_name": "my-app-user-1",
  "conversation_type": "RAG"
}
```

- The response contains a `conversation_id` that can be used to build a chat interface by calling the `/conversation/chat` endpoint.

```json
{
  "message": "how do I make pasta",
  "stream": true,
  "conversation_id": "fc67f202-c2cb-4c3d-a640-704ab83d9460",
  "conversation_type": "RAG"
}
```

These routes are defined the `api/routes` folder and can be customized to your use case.
