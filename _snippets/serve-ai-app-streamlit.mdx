## Serve your App using Streamlit

[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) allows us to build micro front-ends for our AI App and is extremely useful for building basic applications in pure python. Start the `app` group using:

<CodeGroup>

```bash terminal
phi ws up --group app
```

```bash shorthand
phi ws up dev:docker:app
```

</CodeGroup>

**Press Enter** to confirm and give a few minutes for the image to download (only the first time). Verify container status and view logs on the docker dashboard.
