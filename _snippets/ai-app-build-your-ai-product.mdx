## Build your AI Product

Your AI Api provides common endpoints you can use to build your AI product. These routes are developed in collaboration with real AI Apps and are a great starting point to build on.

For example:

- Call the `/assitants/create` endpoint to create a new run for a user.

```json
{
  "user_id": "my-app-user-1",
  "assistant": "RAG_PDF"
}
```

- The response contains a `run_id` that can be used to build a chat interface by calling the `/assitants/chat` endpoint.

```json
{
  "message": "how do I make pasta",
  "stream": true,
  "run_id": "bef092a7-707c-43a4-902c-9fa7fdfa5ff2",
  "user_id": "my-app-user-1",
  "assistant": "RAG_PDF"
}
```

These routes are defined the `api/routes` folder and can be customized to your use case.
