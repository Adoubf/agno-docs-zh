Assistants are a human-like interface to language models that achieve tasks by intelligently choosing a course of action using [function calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling). They come with built-in **Memory**, **Knowledge**, **Storage** and access to **Tools**. A simple assistant looks like:

```python assistant.py
from phi.assistant import Assistant

assistant = Assistant(description="You help people with their health and fitness goals.")

# -*- Print a response
assistant.print_response('Share a quick healthy breakfast recipe.')

# -*- Get the response as a string
response = assistant.run('Share a quick healthy breakfast recipe.', stream=False)

# -*- Get the response as a stream
response = ""
for delta in assistant.run('Share a quick healthy breakfast recipe.'):
    response += delta
```

Under the hood, the description and message are converted into system and user prompts that are sent to the LLM. The prompts can be customized to fit any use case.
