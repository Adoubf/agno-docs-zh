**Assistants** use LLMs to achieve tasks by [calling functions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling). They come with built-in memory, knowledge base and storage, making it easy to build intelligent AI applications.

A simple assistant looks like:

```python assistant.py
from phi.assistant import Assistant

assistant = Assistant(description="You help people with their health and fitness goals.")

# -*- Print a response
assistant.print_response('Share a quick healthy breakfast recipe.', markdown=True)

# -*- Get the response as a string
response = assistant.run('Share a quick healthy breakfast recipe.', stream=False)

# -*- Get the response as a stream
response = ""
for delta in assistant.run('Share a quick healthy breakfast recipe.'):
    response += delta
```

Under the hood, the description and message are converted into system and user prompts that are sent to the LLM. The prompts can be customized to fit any use case.

## Example

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a virtual environment">
    Open the `Terminal` and create an `ai` directory with a python virtual environment.

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash Mac
    mkdir ai && cd ai

    python3 -m venv aienv
    source aienv/bin/activate
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    mkdir ai; cd ai

    python3 -m venv aienv
    aienv/scripts/activate
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Install libraries">
    Install `phidata` and `openai` using pip

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash Mac
    pip install -U phidata openai
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    pip install -U phidata openai
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create an assistant">
    Create a file `assistant.py` with the following contents

    ```python assistant.py
    from phi.assistant import Assistant

    assistant = Assistant(description="You help people with their health and fitness goals.")
    assistant.print_response("Share a quick healthy breakfast recipe.", markdown=True)
    ```

    Set your `OPENAI_API_KEY`

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash Mac
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-***
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    setx OPENAI_API_KEY sk-***
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

    Run the `Assistant`

    ```shell
    python assistant.py
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Let it search the web">

    Add the DuckDuckGo tool to let the assistant search the web

    ```python assistant.py
    from phi.assistant import Assistant
    from phi.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGo

    assistant = Assistant(tools=[DuckDuckGo()], show_tool_calls=True)
    assistant.print_response("Whats happening in France?", markdown=True)
    ```

    Install duckduckgo search

    ```shell
    pip install duckduckgo-search
    ```

    Run the `Assistant`

    ```shell
    python assistant.py
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>
