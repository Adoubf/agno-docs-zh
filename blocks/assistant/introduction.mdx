Assistants are sandboxed **"workers"** that Conversations can delegate tasks to.

Unlike Agents, Assistants run in a separate process and are given tasks to complete. Think of the Conversation as a project manager that delegates tasks to an Assistant. The Assistants completes the task and returns the result to the Conversation.

## Usage

In this example, we use the `PythonAssistant` with a conversation

```python python_assistant.py
from phi.conversation import Conversation
from phi.llm.openai import OpenAIChat
from phi.assistant.python import PythonAssistant
from phi.file.local.csv import CsvFile

from workspace.settings import ws_settings

python_assistant = PythonAssistant(
    files=[
        CsvFile(
            description="Contains information about movies from IMDB.",
            path=str(ws_settings.ws_root.joinpath("data/csv/IMDB-Movie-Data.csv")),
        )
    ],
    base_dir=ws_settings.ws_root.joinpath("pygpt/op"),
    show_function_calls=True,
)

conversation = Conversation(
    llm=OpenAIChat(model="gpt-4"),
    assistants=[python_assistant],
    show_assistant_responses=True,
)

# -*- Print response
conversation.print_response("Show me a table of revenue by year")
```

<Warning>

Assistants are a work in progress and should not be used in production.
