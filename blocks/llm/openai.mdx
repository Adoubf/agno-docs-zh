OpenAI's GPT (generative pre-trained transformer) models are the currently the best in class LLMs and the default for the `Conversation` class.

You can provide your own `OPENAI_API_KEY`, otherwise `phi` provides ready to use access to OpenAI models.

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-***
```

```bash Windows
setx OPENAI_API_KEY sk-***
```

</CodeGroup>

## Usage

<CodeGroup>

```python GPT-3.5
from phi.conversation import Conversation
from phi.llm.openai import OpenAIChat

conversation = Conversation(
    llm=OpenAIChat(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo-16k",
        max_tokens=1024,
        temperature=0.9,
    )
)

# -*- Print a response
conversation.print_response('Share a 5 word horror story.')
```

```python GPT-4
from phi.conversation import Conversation
from phi.llm.openai import OpenAIChat

conversation = Conversation(
    llm=OpenAIChat(
        model="gpt-4",
        max_tokens=1024,
        temperature=0.9,
    )
)

# -*- Print a response
conversation.print_response('Share a 5 word horror story.')
```

</CodeGroup>

## Params

<ResponseField name="model" type="str">
  OpenAI model ID.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="max_tokens" type="int">
  The maximum number of tokens to generate in the chat completion.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="temperature" type="float">
  What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will
  make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more
  focused and deterministic.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="frequency_penalty" type="float">
  Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
  their existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood
  to repeat the same line verbatim.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="presence_penalty" type="float">
  Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
  whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
  talk about new topics.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="top_p" type="float">
  An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where
  the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="stop" type="List[str]">
  Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="user" type="str">
  A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help OpenAI to
  monitor and detect abuse.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="headers" type="Dict[str, Any]">
  Headers added to the OpenAI request.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="logit_bias" type="Any">
  Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion. Accepts
  a json object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the tokenizer)
  to an associated bias value from -100 to 100.
</ResponseField>
