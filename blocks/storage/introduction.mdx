Storage backends enable us to save Assistant runs to a database table and retrieve them across sessions. They are a necessary component when building user facing AI products as any production application will require users to be able to "continue" their conversation with the AI.

Because `Storage` is such a critical component, each phidata template comes pre-configured with `PostgreSQL` as a storage backend. Read more in the [assistant/storage guide](/blocks/assistant/storage).

The following databases are supported:

- [PostgreSQL](/blocks/storage/postgres)
- [SingleStore](/blocks/storage/singlestore)
