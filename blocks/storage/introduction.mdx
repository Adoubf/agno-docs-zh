Storage backends enable us to save Conversations to a database table and retrieve them across sessions. They are a necessary component when building user facing AI products as any production application will require users to be able to "continue" the conversation with the AI.

Because `Storage` is such a critical component, each phidata template comes pre-configured with `PostgreSQL` as a storage backend. Read more in the [Conversations/Storage guide](/blocks/conversation/storage).

The following database backends are supported:

- [PostgreSQL](/blocks/storage/postgres)
- [SingleStore](/blocks/storage/singlestore)
