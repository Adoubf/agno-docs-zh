Conversations come with built-in memory but it only lasts while the session is active. To provide memory across sessions, store the `Conversation` in a database table.

Each phidata template includes PostgreSQL as a storage backend.

The following database backends are supported:

- [PostgreSQL](/blocks/storage/postgres)
- [SingleStore](/blocks/storage/singlestore)
