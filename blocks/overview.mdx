**Phidata provides a powerful set of building blocks for building AI powered software:**

- [Conversations](/blocks/conversations) are a human-like interface to LLMs and the core building block of AI Apps.
- [Agents](/blocks/agents) enable LLMs to run functions and achieve tasks. They make LLMs autonomous.
- [Assistants](/blocks/assistants) are a user-friendly interface to the OpenAI Assistants API.
- [Knowledge Bases](/blocks/knowledge-base) are information stores used by LLMs to improve their responses.
- [Storage](/blocks/storage) enables us to store conversations in a database and provide long-term memory.
- [LLMs](/blocks/llms) are machine-learning models that have been trained to understand natural language and code. They are quickly emerging as the building block of a new computing paradigm.
- [Apps](/blocks/apps) are applications like `FastApi`, `PgVector`, `Streamlit`, `Django` used to run software. They provide the application layer for our AI App.
- [Resources](/blocks/resources) are infrastructure components that help us run the applications. They provide the infrastructure layer for our AI App. Eg: docker container, ECS task, RDS database.
- [Workspace](/blocks/workspace) is the codebase for our AI App.
