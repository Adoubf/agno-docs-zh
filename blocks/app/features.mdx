## Install Requirements on startup

Phidata Apps can install requirements on container startup. Update the `Jupyter` app to:

```python resources.py
...
# -*- Jupyter running on port 8888:8888
jupyter = Jupyter(
    image_tag="4.0.5",
    mount_workspace=True,
    install_requirements=True,
    requirements_file="requirements.txt",
    env_vars={"OPENAI_API_KEY": getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")},
)
...
```

Create a `requirements.txt` file in the same directory

```python requirements.txt
openai
```

## Restart resources

<CodeGroup>

```bash terminal
phi restart resources.py -y
```

```bash full options
phi restart resources.py --yes
```

</CodeGroup>
