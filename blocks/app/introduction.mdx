Apps are tools like `FastApi`, `PgVector`, `Streamlit`, `Jupyter`, `Django` that provide the **"Application Layer"** for our AI products.

Phidata is the first toolkit that enables us to define and run software applications as pydatic objects.

Checkout the following apps you can run on docker:

- [PgVector](/blocks/app/examples/pgvector)
- [Jupyter](/blocks/app/examples/jupyter)
