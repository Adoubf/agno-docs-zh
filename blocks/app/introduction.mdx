Apps are tools like `FastApi`, `PgVector`, `Streamlit`, `Jupyter`, `Django` that we define as python classes and run using `phi start` or `phi ws up`.

## Example

Running `phi start resources.py` will run a Jupyter notebook and PgVector on docker.

```python resources.py
from phi.docker.app.jupyter import Jupyter
from phi.docker.app.postgres import PgVectorDb
from phi.docker.resources import DockerResources

# -*- PgVector running on port 5432:5432
vector_db = PgVectorDb(pg_user="llm", pg_password="llm", pg_database="llm")

# -*- Jupyter running on port 8888:8888
jupyter = Jupyter(mount_workspace=True)

# -*- DockerResources
dev_docker_resources = DockerResources(apps=[vector_db, jupyter])
```

<Tip>

Each App is a pydatic object providing input and type validation.

## Motivation

Apps provide the **"Application Layer"** for our AI products.

The software we write needs to be served by an Application, and this Application needs to **run the same** locally for development and in the cloud for production. By defining **Applications as Code**, we bring the benefits of **Infrastructure as Code** to the software layer.

Defining **Applications as Code** also allows us to package them into templates for use cases like **LLM Apps**, **Rest Apis**, **Web Apps** and **Data Platforms**. This means every phidata template can run locally using docker or on AWS with 1 command.

Finally, defining **Applications as python objects** means we can import them in our code like regular software objects making the following code possible:

```python
from resources import vector_db

db_url=vector_db.get_db_connection_local()
```

Checkout some example apps you can run on docker:

- [Jupyter](/blocks/app/examples/jupyter)

Defining **Applications as Code** offers many benefits, such as:
