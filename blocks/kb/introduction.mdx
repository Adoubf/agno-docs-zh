A Knowledge Base is a database of information that the LLM can search to improve its responses. Knowledge Bases make LLMs respond in a context-aware manner.

## Vector Databases

While any type of storage can act as a knowledge base, vector databases offer the best solution for retrieving relevant results from dense information quickly.

The following vector databases are supported:

- [PgVector](/blocks/vectordb/pgvector)
- [SingleStore](/blocks/vectordb/singlestore)

## Input Data

Your knowledge base needs to be loaded with vector embeddings that can be used for retrieval. You can load the embeddings manually or use one of the following knowledge bases:

- [PDF knowledge base](/blocks/kb/pdf): Load local PDF files to a knowledge base
- [PDF URL knowledge base](/blocks/kb/pdf-url): Load PDF files from a URL to a knowledge base
- [Text knowledge base](/blocks/kb/text): Load text/docx files to a knowledge base
- [JSON knowledge base](/blocks/kb/json): Load JSON files to a knowledge base
- [Website knowledge base](/blocks/kb/website): Load website data to a knowledge base
- [Wikipedia knowledge base](/blocks/kb/wikipedia): Load wikipedia articles to a knowledge base
- [ArXiv knowledge base](/blocks/kb/arxiv): Load ArXiv papers to a knowledge base
- [Combined knowledge base](/blocks/kb/combined): Combine multiple knowledge bases into 1
