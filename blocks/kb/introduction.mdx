A Knowledge Base is a database of information that the LLM can search to improve its responses. They are used to provide additional context to LLMs and make them respond in a context-aware manner.

Knowledge Bases can be used with RAG or Autonomous Conversations.

## Example: RAG Conversation

In this example, we add a Knowledge Base to the `Conversation` and set `add_references_to_prompt=True`. This will search the **Knowledge Base** for information about the `message` and add it to the **User Prompt** before sending it to the LLM.

```python rag_conversation.py
from phi.llm.openai import OpenAIChat
from phi.conversation import Conversation
from phi.knowledge.pdf import PDFKnowledgeBase
from phi.vectordb.pgvector import PgVector

rag_conversation = Conversation(
    # -*- Provide the conversation with a knowledge base
    knowledge_base=PDFKnowledgeBase(
        path="data/pdfs",
        vector_db=PgVector(
            collection="pdf_documents",
            db_url=db_url,
        ),
    ),
    # -*- This setting adds references to the user prompt enabling RAG
    add_references_to_prompt=True,
)
```

## Example: Autonomous Conversation

In this example, we add a Knowledge Base to the `Conversation` and set `function_calls=True`. This adds a function for searching the **Knowledge Base** and lets the LLM decide when its needs to access the knowledge base and what search parameters to use.

```python auto_conversation.py
from phi.llm.openai import OpenAIChat
from phi.conversation import Conversation
from phi.knowledge.pdf import PDFUrlKnowledgeBase
from phi.vectordb.pgvector import PgVector

auto_conversation = Conversation(
    # -*- Provide the conversation with a knowledge base
    knowledge_base=PDFKnowledgeBase(
        path="data/pdfs",
        vector_db=PgVector(
            collection="pdf_documents",
            db_url=db_url,
        ),
    ),
    # -*- Let the LLM call functions to achieve tasks
    function_calls=True,
    # -*- Print the signature of called functions
    show_function_calls=True,
)
```

## Vector Databases

While any type of storage can act as a knowledge base, vector databases offer the best solution for retrieving relevant results from dense information quickly.

## Loading the Knowledge Base

Before you can use a knowledge base, it needs to be loaded with embedding vectors that will be used for retrieval. Use one of the following knowledge bases to simplify the chunking, loading, searching and optimization process:

- [PDF knowledge base](/blocks/kb/pdf): Load local PDF files to a knowledge base
- [PDF URL knowledge base](/blocks/kb/pdf-url): Load PDF files from a URL to a knowledge base
- [Text knowledge base](/blocks/kb/text): Load text/docx files to a knowledge base
- [JSON knowledge base](/blocks/kb/json): Load JSON files to a knowledge base
- [Website knowledge base](/blocks/kb/website): Load website data to a knowledge base
- [Wikipedia knowledge base](/blocks/kb/wikipedia): Load wikipedia articles to a knowledge base
- [ArXiv knowledge base](/blocks/kb/arxiv): Load ArXiv papers to a knowledge base
- [Combined knowledge base](/blocks/kb/combined): Combine multiple knowledge bases into 1
- [LangChain knowledge base](/blocks/kb/langchain): Use a Langchain retriever as a knowledge base
- [Load knowledge base manually](/blocks/kb/manual)
