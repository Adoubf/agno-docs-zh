title: Introduction

Resources are infrastructure components used by our applications. Similar to [Apps](/blocks/app/introduction), we define them as python classes and create using `phi start` or `phi ws up`.

## Examples

- Docker containers, images, volumes
- RDS database, S3 bucket, ECS services, task definitions, security groups

<CodeGroup>

```python Docker Image
from phi.docker.resource.image import DockerImage

dev_image = DockerImage(
    name="repo/image",
    tag="latest",
    push_image=True,,
)
```

```python S3 Bucket
from phi.aws.resource.s3 import S3Bucket

# -*- An S3 bucket called my-bucket
prd_bucket = S3Bucket(name="my-bucket")
```

```python Secret
from pathlib import Path
from phi.aws.resource.secret import SecretsManager

# -*- A Secret called my-secret
prd_secret = SecretsManager(
    name="my-secret",
    # Read secret variables from my_secrets.yml
    secret_files=[Path('my_secrets.yml')],
)
```

```python RDS Database
from pathlib import Path
from phi.aws.resource.secret import SecretsManager

# -*- Database Secret
db_secret = SecretsManager(
    name="my-db-secret",
    # Read secret variables from db_secrets.yml
    secret_files=[Path('db_secrets.yml')],
)

# -*- Database Subnet Group
db_subnet_group = DbSubnetGroup(name="my-db-sg")

# -*- Database Instance
db = DbInstance(
    name="my-db",
    db_name="llm",
    port=5423,
    engine="postgres",
    engine_version="16.1",
    allocated_storage=64,
    db_instance_class="db.t4g.medium",
    db_subnet_group=db_subnet_group,
    availability_zone="us-east-1a",
    publicly_accessible=True,
    aws_secret=db_secret,
)
```

<Tip>

Each Resource is a pydatic object providing input and type validation.

## Motivation

Resources provide the **"Infrastructure Layer"** for our AI products. The software we write needs to be served by an Application, which in turn needs to run on an Infrastructure Resoure.

Defining **Applications as Code** and **Infrastructure as Code** allows us completely write our application as python code - providing numerous benefits like re-usability, version control, unit testing, formatting.

Phidata currently supports resources for:

- [Docker](/blocks/resource/docker)
- [AWS](/blocks/resource/aws)
