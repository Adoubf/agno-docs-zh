Tools are functions that the Assistant can run to achieve tasks.

They enable LLMs to "take actions" by calling functions and intelligently choose their path based on the response, solving problems in a human-like manner.

For example, to build a text-to-SQL assistant, we can provide tools to view and describe tables, search the knowledge base for context and run queries after inspecting them. This allows the text-to-SQL assistant to work through the problem in an intelligent manner.

Assistants have access to a set of default tools like searching the **Knowledge Base** and **Memory** that can be enabled by setting `use_tools=True`.

For example the `auto_assistant` will can search its knowledge base or chat history depending on the question, yielding better responses than prompt stuffing.

```python auto_assistant.py
from phi.assistant import Assistant
from phi.knowledge.pdf import PDFUrlKnowledgeBase
from phi.vectordb.pgvector import PgVector2

from resources import vector_db

knowledge_base = PDFUrlKnowledgeBase(
    urls=["https://phi-public.s3.amazonaws.com/recipes/ThaiRecipes.pdf"],
    vector_db=PgVector2(
        collection="recipes",
        db_url=vector_db.get_db_connection_local(),
    ),
)
knowledge_base.load(recreate=False)

auto_assistant = Assistant(
    knowledge_base=knowledge_base,
    # use_tools adds the `search_knowledge_base` and `get_chat_history` functions
    use_tools=True,
    show_tool_calls=True,
)

# will call `search_knowledge_base` to generate this response
auto_assistant.print_response('How do I make pad thai?')
# will call `get_chat_history` to generate this response
auto_assistant.print_response('What was my last question?')
```

## Params

The following fields allow the `Assistant` to use tools

<ResponseField
  name="tools"
  type="List[Union[Tool, ToolRegistry, Callable, Dict, Function]]"
>
  A list of tools provided to the LLM.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="use_tools" type="bool" default="False">
  Makes the assistant `Autonomous` by letting the LLM use tools to achieve
  tasks. When true, 2 default tools: `search_knowledge_base` and `get_chat_history` are added.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="show_tool_calls" type="bool" default="False">
  Print the signature of called tools.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="tool_call_limit" type="int">
  Maximum number of tool calls allowed.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="tool_choice" type="Union[str, Dict[str, Any]]">
  Controls which (if any) tool is called by the model.
  - "none" means the model will not call a tool and instead generates a message.
  - "auto" means the model can pick between generating a message or calling a tool.
  - Specifying a particular function via
  ```
  {
    "type: "function",
    "function": {"name": "my_function"}
  }
  ```
  forces the model to call that tool.

"none" is the default when no tools are present. "auto" is the default if tools are present.

</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="update_knowledge_base" type="bool" default="False">
  If use_tools is True and update_knowledge_base is True, then a `add_to_knowledge_base` tool is added that allows the LLM to update the knowledge base.
</ResponseField>
<ResponseField name="read_tool_call_history" type="bool" default="False">
  If use_tools is True and read_tool_call_history is True, then `get_tool_call_history` tool is added that allows the LLM to get the tool call history.
</ResponseField>
