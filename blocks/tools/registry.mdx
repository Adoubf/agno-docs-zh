**Tool Registry** is a collection of tools designed to achieve specific tasks.

For example `PythonTools` can be added to an Assistant to enable it to run python code to achieve tasks. The following assistant will write a python script to get top hackernews stories, save it to a file, run it and return the results.

```python python_tools.py
from phi.assistant import Assistant
from phi.tools.python import PythonTools

assistant = Assistant(tools=[PythonTools()], show_tool_calls=True)
assistant.print_response("Summarize the top stories on hackernews")
```
