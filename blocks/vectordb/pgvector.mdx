title: PgVector
---

We're big fans of using **PgVector** for vector storage because it delivers spectacular results for 99.9% of the use-cases and can also provide long-term storage for our `Conversations`.

## Run PgVector

Each template already comes with PgVector pre-configured but if needed, your can easily run `PgVector` on `Docker`.

Create a file `resources.py` with the following contents and start `PgVector` by running `phi start resources.py`

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
phi start resources.py
```

```bash Windows
phi start resources.py
```

</CodeGroup>

```python resources.py
from phi.docker.app.postgres import PgVectorDb
from phi.docker.resources import DockerResources

# -*- PgVector running on port 5432:5432
vector_db = PgVectorDb(
    pg_user="llm",
    pg_password="llm",
    pg_database="llm",
    debug_mode=True,
)

# -*- DockerResources
dev_docker_resources = DockerResources(
    apps=[vector_db],
)
```

<Note>

Install [docker desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) if needed.
