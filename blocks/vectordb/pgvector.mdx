title: PgVector

We're big fans of using **PgVector** for vector storage because it delivers spectacular results for 99.9% of the use-cases and can also provide long-term storage for our `Conversations`.

It runs locally on docker and is provided as a resilient service by major cloud providers. It truly is a remarkable option -- just without the marketing budget of other vector databases.
