While any type of storage can act as a knowledge base, vector databases currently offer the best solution for retrieving relevant results from dense information quickly.

Each phidata template includes PgVector as a VectorDb.

The following VectorDb are supported:

- [PgVector](/blocks/vectordb/pgvector)
- [SingleStore](/blocks/vectordb/singlestore)
