title: Pydantic models as output
---

One of our favorite features is generating structured data from sparse information.

Meaning we can use LLMs to fill in pydantic models and generate content which previously could not be possible. Use it to generate movie plots, storylines, fake data and so much more...

## Usage

```python movie_generator.py
from typing import List
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from phi.conversation import Conversation
from rich.pretty import pprint

class MovieGenerator(BaseModel):
    setting: str = Field(..., description="Setting of the movie. If not available, provide a random setting.")
    ending: str = Field(..., description="Ending of the movie. If not available, provide a happy ending.")
    genre: str = Field(..., description="Genre of the movie. If not available, select romantic comedy.")
    name: str = Field(..., description="Give a name to this movie")
    characters: List[str] = Field(..., description="Name of characters for this movie.")
    storyline: str = Field(..., description="2 sentence story of the movie.")

movie_generator = Conversation(
    system_prompt="Generate a movie",
    output_model=MovieGenerator,
)

pprint(movie_generator.run("New York"))

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash Mac
    mkdir ai && cd ai

    python3 -m venv aienv
    source aienv/bin/activate
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    mkdir ai; cd ai

    python3 -m venv aienv
    aienv/scripts/activate
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Install libraries">
    Install libraries using pip

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash Mac
    pip install -U phidata openai
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    pip install -U phidata openai
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a conversation with an output_model">
    Create a file `movie_generator.py` with the following contents

```python movie_generator.py
from typing import List
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from phi.conversation import Conversation
from rich.pretty import pprint

class MovieGenerator(BaseModel):
    setting: str = Field(..., description="Setting of the movie. If not available, provide a random setting.")
    ending: str = Field(..., description="Ending of the movie. If not available, provide a happy ending.")
    genre: str = Field(..., description="Genre of the movie. If not available, select romantic comedy.")
    name: str = Field(..., description="Give a name to this movie")
    characters: List[str] = Field(..., description="Name of characters for this movie.")
    storyline: str = Field(..., description="2 sentence story of the movie.")

movie_generator = Conversation(
    system_prompt="Generate a movie",
    output_model=MovieGenerator,
)

pprint(movie_generator.run("New York"))
```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the conversation">
    Run the `movie_generator.py` file
```bash
python movie_generator.py
```
  </Step>
