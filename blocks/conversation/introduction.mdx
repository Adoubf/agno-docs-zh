Conversations are a human-like interface to language models and the starting point for every AI App. We send the LLM a message and get a model-generated output as a response.

Conversations come with built-in **Memory**, **Knowledge**, **Storage** and access to **Tools**.

Giving LLMs the ability to have long-term, knowledge-based **Conversations** is the first step in our journey to AGI. A simple example looks like:

```python conversation.py
from phi.conversation import Conversation

conversation = Conversation()

# -*- Print a response
conversation.print_response('Share a quick healthy breakfast recipe.')

# -*- Get the response as a string
response = conversation.chat('Share a quick healthy breakfast recipe.', stream=False)

# -*- Get the response as a stream
response = ""
for delta in conversation.chat('Share a quick healthy breakfast recipe.'):
    response += delta
```

Under the hood, the message is converted to `System` and `User` prompts that are sent to the LLM. The default prompts can be easily customized to fit any use case.

## Example

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a virtual environment">
    Open the `Terminal` and create an `ai` directory with a python virtual environment.

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash Mac
    mkdir ai && cd ai

    python3 -m venv aienv
    source aienv/bin/activate
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    mkdir ai; cd ai

    python3 -m venv aienv
    aienv/scripts/activate
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Install libraries">
    Install `phidata` and `openai` using pip

    <CodeGroup>

    ```bash Mac
    pip install -U phidata openai
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    pip install -U phidata openai
    ```

    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create a conversation">
    Create a file `conversation.py` with the following contents

```python conversation.py
from phi.conversation import Conversation

conversation = Conversation()

# -*- Print a response
conversation.print_response('Share a quick healthy breakfast recipe.')
```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the conversation">
    Run the `conversation.py` file
```bash
python conversation.py
```
  </Step>
</Steps>
