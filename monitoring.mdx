## Monitoring

Phidata comes with built-in monitoring. You can set `monitoring=True` on any agent to track sessions or set `PHI_MONITORING=true` in your environment to log all agent sessions.

<Note>Run `phi auth` to authenticate your local account or export the `PHI_API_KEY`</Note>

```python monitoring.py
from phi.agent import Agent

agent = Agent(markdown=True, monitoring=True)
agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story")
```

Run the agent and view the session on [phidata.app/sessions](https://www.phidata.app/sessions)

```shell
# You can also set the environment variable
# export PHI_MONITORING=true

python monitoring.py
```

## Debugging

Phidata also includes a built-in debugger that will show debug logs in the terminal. You can set `debug_mode=True` on any agent to view debug logs or set `PHI_DEBUG=true` in your environment.

```python debugging.py
from phi.agent import Agent

agent = Agent(markdown=True, debug_mode=True)
agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story")
```

Run the agent to view debug logs in the terminal:

```shell
# You can also set the environment variable
# export PHI_DEBUG=true

python debugging.py
```
