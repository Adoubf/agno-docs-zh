Create a file `resources.py` with the following contents:

```python resources.py
from phi.docker.app.postgres import PgVectorDb
from phi.docker.resources import DockerResources

# -*- PgVector running on port 5432:5432
vector_db = PgVectorDb(
    pg_user="llm",
    pg_password="llm",
    pg_database="llm",
    debug_mode=True,
)

# -*- DockerResources
dev_docker_resources = DockerResources(
    apps=[vector_db],
)
```

## Start resources

Start resources using:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
phi start resources.py
```

```bash Windows
phi start resources.py
```

</CodeGroup>

**Press Enter** to confirm and give a few minutes for the image to download (only the first time). Verify container status and view logs on the docker dashboard.

## Stop resources

When done, stop resources using:

<CodeGroup>

```bash Mac
phi stop resources.py
```

```bash Windows
phi stop resources.py
```

</CodeGroup>
