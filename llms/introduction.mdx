Large Language Models are machine-learning models that are trained to understand natural language and code. They are quickly emerging as the building block of a new computing paradigm. Use any `llm` with an Assistant like:

```python
from phi.assistant import Assistant
from phi.llm.openai import OpenAIChat

assistant = Assistant(
    llm=OpenAIChat(model="gpt-4-turbo"),
    description="You provide 15 minute healthy recipes.",
)
assistant.print_response("Share a breakfast recipe.", markdown=True)
```
