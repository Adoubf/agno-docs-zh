To run agents in production, we need to:
1. Serve them using an application like **FastApi**, **Django** or **Streamlit**
2. Store their sessions, memory and knowlege in a database.
3. Continously monitor and evaluate their performance.

Phidata not only makes building Agents easy but also helps you run them in production by providing templates with all the infrastructure already pre-configured. You can run the templates locally using docker or deploy to your AWS account. Here's how they work:

- Create your codebase using a template: `phi ws create`
- Run your app locally: `phi ws up`
- Run your app on AWS: `phi ws up prd:aws`

<Note>
We strongly believe that data used by AI applications should be stored securely in your own cloud, inside your VPC. We fully support BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud).

## Templates

We recommend starting with the `agent-app` template and adding your own agents.
