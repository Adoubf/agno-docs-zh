title: Introduction
---

To run agents in production, we need to serve them using an application like **FastApi**, **Django** or **Streamlit** and store their sessions, memory and knowlege in a database. Phidata not only makes building Agents easy, but also manages the infrastructure required to run them at scale.

Phidata provides pre-built templates that come with all the infrastructure you need to run agents at scale (database, containers, loadbalancer, etc), in your own cloud.

You can run the templates locally using docker or deploy to AWS. Here's how they work:

- Create your codebase using a template: `phi ws create`
- Run your app locally: `phi ws up`
- Run your app on AWS: `phi ws up prd:aws`

<Note>
We strongly believe that data used by AI applications should be stored securely in your own cloud, inside your VPC. Therefore fully support BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud).
</Note>

## Templates

We recommend using the `agent-app` template for starting with a simple app that you can extend with your own agents.
