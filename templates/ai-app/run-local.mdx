This template provides an AI App built with [FastApi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/), [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) and [PgVector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector). Run it locally using docker and in production on AWS.

**By the end of this guide you'll have an AI App built with:**

- **GPT-4** as the LLM
- **PostgreSQL** for knowledge and storage
- **Streamlit** and **FastApi** for serving Assistants
- **Docker** for running locally
- **AWS** for running in production
