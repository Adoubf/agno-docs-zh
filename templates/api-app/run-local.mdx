The `api-app` template gives us a production-ready RestAPI built with [FastApi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

**By the end of this guide you'll have your own RestAPI built with:**

- **FastApi** for serving
- **PostgreSQL** for knowledge and storage
- **Docker** for running locally
- **AWS** for running in production

<Note>

Phidata's own RestAPI serving millions of requests is built using this template.

### Sample API Endpoints

- Open [localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) to view sample API Endpoints.
- Load the knowledge base using `/v1/pdf/conversation/load-knowledge-base`
- Test the `v1/pdf/conversation/chat` endpoint with

```json
{
  "message": "How do I make chicken curry?"
}
```

## Optional: Build your AI Product

The `api-app` provides sample endpoints you can use to build your own AI product. These routes are developed in collaboration with real AI Apps and are a great starting point to build on. For example:

- Call the `/conversation/create` endpoint to create a new conversation for a user.

```json
{
  "user_name": "my-app-user-1",
  "conversation_type": "RAG"
}
```

- The response contains a `conversation_id` that can be used to build a chat interface by calling the `/conversation/chat` endpoint.

```json
{
  "message": "how do I make pasta",
  "stream": true,
  "conversation_id": "fc67f202-c2cb-4c3d-a640-704ab83d9460",
  "conversation_type": "RAG"
}
```

These routes are defined the `api/routes` folder and can be customized to your use case.
