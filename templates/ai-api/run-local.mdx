The `ai-api` template provides a production-ready RestAPI built with [FastApi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

**By the end of this guide you'll have your own RestAPI built with:**

- **FastApi** for serving
- **PostgreSQL** for knowledge and storage
- **Docker** for running locally
- **AWS** for running in production

<Note>

Phidata's own RestAPI serving millions of requests is built using this template.
