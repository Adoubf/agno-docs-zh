sidebarTitle: "Run locally"

[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) is an exceptional choice for building a full-stack Web App in 2024. It stands apart from typical hype cycles and is known for its maturity and stability. Combined with [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) it truly is one of our favourite frameworks.

In this guide, we'll build a Web App using:

- **Django** as the web framework
- **PostgreSQL** as the database
- **GPT-4** as the LLM
- **Docker** for running locally
- **AWS** for running in production
