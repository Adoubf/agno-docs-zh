sidebarTitle: "Run locally"

Almost every production AI application is built using a front-end framework like [next.js](https://nextjs.org) combined with a RestAPI and database, a task where [FastApi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) & [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) shine.

In this guide, let's build a RestApi for serving Assitants. We'll use:

- **GPT-4** as the LLM
- **FastApi** as the API
- **PostgreSQL** as the database providing knowledge and storage
- **Docker** for running locally
- **AWS** for running in production

<Note>

Phidata's own RestAPI serving millions of requests is built using this.
