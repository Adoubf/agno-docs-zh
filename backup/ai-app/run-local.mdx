Let's build an AI App that can:

1. Chat with PDFs (RAG & Autonomous)
2. Chat with Images
3. Chat with Websites (RAG & Autonomous)

We'll use:

- **GPT-4** as the LLM.
- **Streamlit** as the chat interface
- **PgVector** for knowledge and storage
- **Optional: FastApi** for serving our AI App as an API
- **Optional: Jupyter** for testing our AI in notebooks.

**By the end of this guide you'll have an AI App to customise and make your own.**
