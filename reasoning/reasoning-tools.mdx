title: Reasoning Tools
---

By giving a model a **"think" tool**, we can greatly improve its reasoning capabilities by providing a dedicated space for structured thinking. This is a simple, yet effective approach to add reasoning to non-reasoning models.

First published by Anthropic in [this blog post](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-think-tool), this technique has been practiced by many AI Engineers (including our own team) long before it was published.

### Example

```python claude_reasoning_tools.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.anthropic import Claude
from agno.tools.reasoning import ReasoningTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

reasoning_agent = Agent(
    model=Claude(id="claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219"),
    tools=[
        ReasoningTools(add_instructions=True, add_few_shot=True),
        YFinanceTools(stock_price=True, analyst_recommendations=True, company_info=True, company_news=True),
    ],
    show_tool_calls=True,
)
reasoning_agent.print_response(
    "Write a report comparing NVDA to TSLA", stream=True, markdown=True
)
```
