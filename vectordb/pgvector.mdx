title: PgVector
---

We're big fans of using **PgVector** for vector storage because it delivers spectacular results for 99.9% of the use-cases and can also provide long-term storage for Assistants.

It runs locally on docker and is provided as a resilient service by major cloud providers. It truly is a remarkable option -- just without the marketing budget of other vector databases.

## Run PgVector

We provide a way to run PgVector locally using docker as a phidata resource, this is purely so we can create volumes, set env variables and initialize the extension. You may run PgVector any way you like, using `docker-compose` or `docker run` directly.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install Docker">
    Install [docker desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) for running PgVector in a container.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define PgVector as a resource">
    Create a file `resources.py` with the following contents

    ```python resources.py
    from phi.docker.app.postgres import PgVectorDb

    # -*- Run PgVector on port 5532 as port 5432 may be in use.
    vector_db = PgVectorDb(
        pg_user="ai",
        pg_password="ai",
        pg_database="ai",
        host_port=5532,
    )
    ```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Start PgVector">
    Start `resources.py` using:

    ```bash
    phi start resources.py
    ```

    **Press Enter** to confirm. You can verify container status on the docker dashboard.
