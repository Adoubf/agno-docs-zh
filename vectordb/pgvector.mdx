title: PgVector
---

We're big fans of using **PgVector** for vector storage because it delivers spectacular results for 99.9% of the use-cases and can also provide long-term storage for Agents.

It runs locally on docker and is provided as a resilient service by major cloud providers. It truly is a remarkable option -- just without the marketing budget of other vector databases.

## Run PgVector

Install [docker desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) and run **PgVector** on port **5532** using:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -e POSTGRES_DB=ai \
  -e POSTGRES_USER=ai \
  -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=ai \
  -e PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata \
  -v pgvolume:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
  -p 5532:5432 \
  --name pgvector \
  phidata/pgvector:16
