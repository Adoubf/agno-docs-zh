Vector databases enable us to store information as embeddings and search for "results similar" to our input query using cosine similarity or full text search. These results are then provided to the Agent as context so it can respond in a context-aware manner using Retrieval Augmented Generation (**RAG**).

Here's how vector databases are used with Agents:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Chunk the information">
    Break down the knowledge into smaller chunks to ensure our search query returns only relevant results.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Load the knowledge base">
    Convert the chunks into embedding vectors and store them in a vector database.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Search the knowledge base">
    When the user sends a message, we convert the input message into an embedding and "search" for nearest neighbors in the vector database.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The following VectorDb are currently supported:

- [PgVector](/vectordb/pgvector)
- [LanceDb](/vectordb/lancedb)
- [Pinecone](/vectordb/pinecone)
- [SingleStore](/vectordb/singlestore)
