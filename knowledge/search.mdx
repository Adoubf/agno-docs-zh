title: Agentic Search
---

**Agentic Search** is using the Agent to search for information at runtime.

By adding a knowledge base to an Agent, we're essentially giving the model, a tool to search for information at runtime. The Model understands the input message and generates a set of keywords, which are used to call the `search_knowledge_base()` tool.

Becuase the Agent is searching for the information it needs (at runtime), the "searching on demand" pattern is referred to as **Agentic Search** and is becoming very popular with Agent builders.
