title: Agentic Search
---

Using an Agent to dynamically search for information at runtime is called **Agentic Search** and this process of **searching, reasoning and responding** is known as **Agentic RAG**.

The Model interprets a user question, generates a set of keywords and uses them to search its knowledge base. The key point to note is that **the quality of the search results determines the quality of the Agent's response**.

You can use semantic search, keyword search or hybrid search. We recommend using **hybrid search with reranking** for best in class knowledge retrieval.

Because the Agent is searching for the information it needs on demand, this pattern is called **Agentic Search** and is becoming very popular with Agent builders.

Let's build some examples to see Agentic Search in action.

## Agentic RAG

When we add a knowledge base to an Agent, behind the scenes, we give the model a tool to search that knowledge base for the information it needs.

The Model generates a set of keywords and calls the `search_knowledge_base()` tool to retrieve the relevant information or few-shot examples.

Here's a working example that uses Hybrid Search + Reranking:

<Tip>
You may remove the reranking step if you don't need it.

## Agentic RAG with Reasoning

We can further improve the Agents search capabilities by giving it the ability to reason about the search results.

By adding reasoning, the Agent "thinks" first about what to search and then "analyzes" the results of the search.

Here's an example of an Agentic RAG Agent that uses reasoning to improve the quality of the search results.

```python agentic_rag_reasoning.py
"""This cookbook shows how to implement Agentic RAG with Reasoning.

2. Export your ANTHROPIC_API_KEY and CO_API_KEY
3. Run: `python cookbook/agent_concepts/agentic_search/agentic_rag_with_reasoning.py` to run the agent
