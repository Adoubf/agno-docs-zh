In software engineering, **Day 2** is when the work begins.

- **Day 0**: Run the application locally for development.
- **Day 1**: Run the application in production.
- **Day 2**: Improve, update and maintain the application as a team.

**Day-2** is the hardest part of software engineering and phidata templates are designed with best practices to make Day 2 easy. Go over the following as needed:
