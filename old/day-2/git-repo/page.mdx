1. Create a new [git respository](https://github.com/new).

2. Push your code to the git repository.

```bash terminal
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Init LLM App"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/[YOUR_GIT_REPO].git
git push -u origin main
```

3. Your team can then follow the [setup steps for new users](/how-to/new-users) to use this workspace.
