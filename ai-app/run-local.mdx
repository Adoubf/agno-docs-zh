To build an AI Application, we serve Assistants using tools like **Streamlit**, **FastApi** or **Django**. Instead of wiring these tools manually, phidata provides **pre-built templates** you can run locally or deploy to AWS. Let's build an AI App serving a **PDF**, **Image** and **Website** Assistant using:

- **GPT-4** as the LLM.
- **Streamlit** as the chat interface
- **FastApi** as a RestAPI
- **PgVector** for knowledge and storage

**By the end of this guide you'll have an AI App to customise and make your own.**
