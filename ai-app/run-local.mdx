To build an AI Application, we serve Assistants using tools like **Streamlit**, **FastApi** or **Django**. Instead of wiring these tools manually, phidata provides **pre-built templates** to get you started quickly. Let's build an AI App with a **PDF**, **Vision** and **Website** Assistant, we'll use:

- **GPT-4** as the LLM.
- **Streamlit** as the chat interface
- **FastApi** as a RestAPI for your product
- **PgVector** for knowledge and storage

**By the end of this guide you'll have an AI App that you can integrate with your product.**
