## What are Agents?

**Agents** are AI programs that operate autonomously.

- The **brain** of an Agent is the model that it uses to reason, execute, and respond to the user.
- The **body** of an Agent is the tools it uses to interact with the real world.
- The **behavior** of an Agent is defined by instructions; the better the model, the better it is at following instructions.

Agents also have **memory**, **knowledge**, **storage** and the ability to **reason**:

- **knowledge:** is domain-specific information the Agent can **_search on demand_** to make better decisions and provide accurate responses. Knowledge is stored in a vector database and this **_search on demand_** pattern is known as Agentic RAG.
- **storage:** is used by Agents to save session history and state in a database. Model APIs are stateless and storage makes Agents stateful, enabling long-term multi-turn conversations.
- **memory:** gives Agents the ability to store and recall information from previous interactions, allowing them to learn user preferences and personalize their responses.
- **reasoning:** enables Agents to "think" before responding and "analyze" the results of their actions (i.e. tool calls), this greatly improves the Agents ability to solve complex problems.

<Check>Let's build a few Agents to see how they work.</Check>

## Basic Agent

The simplest Agent is just an inference task, no reasoning, tools, memory or knowledge.

```python basic_agent.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    description="You are an enthusiastic news reporter with a flair for storytelling!",
    markdown=True
)
agent.print_response("Tell me about a breaking news story from New York.", stream=True)
```

To run the agent, install dependencies and export your `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Setup your virtual environment">

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Mac
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    python3 -m venv aienv
    aienv/scripts/activate
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Install dependencies">

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Mac
    pip install -U openai agno
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    pip install -U openai agno
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Export your OpenAI key">

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Mac
    export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-***
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    setx OPENAI_API_KEY sk-***
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the agent">

    ```shell
    python basic_agent.py
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Agent with tools

This basic agent will obviously make up a story, lets give it a tool to search the web.

```python agent_with_tools.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    description="You are an enthusiastic news reporter with a flair for storytelling!",
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    show_tool_calls=True,
    markdown=True
)
agent.print_response("Tell me about a breaking news story from New York.", stream=True)
```

Install dependencies and run the Agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install dependencies">

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Mac
    pip install -U duckduckgo-search
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    pip install -U duckduckgo-search
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the agent">

    ```shell
    python agent_with_tools.py
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

Now you should see a much more relevant result.

## Agent with knowledge

Agents can store knowledge in a vector database and use it for RAG or dynamic few-shot learning.

**Agno agents use Agentic RAG** by default, which means they will search their knowledge base for the specific information they need to achieve their task.

```python agent_with_knowledge.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.embedder.openai import OpenAIEmbedder
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools
from agno.knowledge.pdf_url import PDFUrlKnowledgeBase
from agno.vectordb.lancedb import LanceDb, SearchType

agent = Agent(
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    description="You are a Thai cuisine expert!",
    instructions=[
        "Search your knowledge base for Thai recipes.",
        "If the question is better suited for the web, search the web to fill in gaps.",
        "Prefer the information in your knowledge base over the web results."
    ],
    knowledge=PDFUrlKnowledgeBase(
        urls=["https://agno-public.s3.amazonaws.com/recipes/ThaiRecipes.pdf"],
        vector_db=LanceDb(
            uri="tmp/lancedb",
            table_name="recipes",
            search_type=SearchType.hybrid,
            embedder=OpenAIEmbedder(id="text-embedding-3-small"),
        ),
    ),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    show_tool_calls=True,
    markdown=True
)

# Comment out after the knowledge base is loaded
if agent.knowledge is not None:
    agent.knowledge.load()

agent.print_response("How do I make chicken and galangal in coconut milk soup", stream=True)
agent.print_response("What is the history of Thai curry?", stream=True)
```

Install dependencies and run the Agent

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install dependencies">

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Mac
    pip install -U lancedb tantivy pypdf duckduckgo-search
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    pip install -U lancedb tantivy pypdf duckduckgo-search
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the agent">

    ```shell
    python agent_with_knowledge.py
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Multi Agent Teams

Agents work best when they have a singular purpose, a narrow scope and a small number of tools. When the number of tools grows beyond what the language model can handle or the tools belong to different categories, use a team of agents to spread the load.

```python agent_team.py
from agno.agent import Agent
from agno.models.openai import OpenAIChat
from agno.tools.duckduckgo import DuckDuckGoTools
from agno.tools.yfinance import YFinanceTools

web_agent = Agent(
    name="Web Agent",
    role="Search the web for information",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()],
    instructions="Always include sources",
    show_tool_calls=True,
    markdown=True,
)

finance_agent = Agent(
    name="Finance Agent",
    role="Get financial data",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    tools=[YFinanceTools(stock_price=True, analyst_recommendations=True, company_info=True)],
    instructions="Use tables to display data",
    show_tool_calls=True,
    markdown=True,
)

agent_team = Agent(
    team=[web_agent, finance_agent],
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4o"),
    instructions=["Always include sources", "Use tables to display data"],
    show_tool_calls=True,
    markdown=True,
)

agent_team.print_response("What's the market outlook and financial performance of AI semiconductor companies?", stream=True)
```

Install dependencies and run the Agent team

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install dependencies">

    <CodeGroup>
    ```bash Mac
    pip install -U duckduckgo-search yfinance
    ```

    ```bash Windows
    pip install -U duckduckgo-search yfinance
    ```
    </CodeGroup>

  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the agent">

    ```shell
    python agent_team.py
    ```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Debugging

Want to see the system prompt, user messages and tool calls?

Agno includes a built-in debugger that will print debug logs in the terminal. Set `debug_mode=True` on any agent or set `AGNO_DEBUG=true` in your environment.

```python debugging.py
from agno.agent import Agent

agent = Agent(markdown=True, debug_mode=True)
agent.print_response("Share a 2 sentence horror story")
```

Run the agent to view debug logs in the terminal:

```shell
python debugging.py
```
